              "'\\n---\\nQuestion: *  What are the key modules in an LLM-based autonomous agent architecture?\\nAnswer: Based on the provided context, the key modules in an LLM-based autonomous agent architecture are:\\n\\n1.  **Planning:**\\n    *   **Subgoal and decomposition:** Breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals.\\n    *   **Reflection and refinement:** Self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions to learn from mistakes and improve future steps.\\n\\n2.  **Memory:** (The context mentions memory as a key component but doesn\\'t provide details.)\\n\\nThe context also mentions that the LLM functions as the agent\\'s brain within this architecture.\\n---\\nQuestion: *  How does planning work in an LLM-powered autonomous agent?\\nAnswer: Planning in an LLM-powered autonomous agent involves several key aspects:\\n\\n**1. Task Decomposition:**\\n\\n*   Large, complex tasks are broken down into smaller, more manageable subgoals. This allows the agent to handle complexity more effectively.\\n*   Techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting can be used to instruct the LLM to \"think step by step,\" decomposing tasks into simpler steps.\\n*   Tree of Thoughts (ToT) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step, creating a tree structure of thoughts.  The search process can be BFS or DFS.\\n*   Task decomposition can be achieved through simple LLM prompting (e.g., \"Steps for XYZ\"), task-specific instructions, or human input.\\n\\n**2. Subgoal and Decomposition:**\\n\\n*   Breaking down tasks into subgoals is a core element of planning, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\n\\n**3. Reflection and Refinement:**\\n\\n*   The agent engages in self-criticism and self-reflection on past actions.\\n*   It learns from mistakes and refines its plans for future steps, improving the quality of final results.\\n*   Self-reflection is vital for iterative improvement, especially in real-world tasks where trial and error are common.\\n\\n**4. External Planning (LLM+P):**\\n\\n*   An alternative approach involves using an external classical planner for long-horizon planning.\\n*   The LLM translates the problem into Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL).\\n*   A classical planner generates a PDDL plan.\\n*   The LLM then translates the PDDL plan back into natural language.\\n*   This approach outsources the planning step to an external tool.\\n\\n**5. ReAct Framework:**\\n\\n*   Integrates reasoning and acting within the LLM.\\n*   Extends the action space to include task-specific discrete actions and the language space.\\n*   Uses a prompt template that incorporates explicit steps for the LLM to think.\\n\\n**6. Heuristics:**\\n\\n*   Heuristic functions can be used to determine when a trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped.\\n*   Inefficient planning can refer to trajectories that take too long without success.\\n*   Hallucination can be defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\n\\n**7. Memory integration with Self-Reflection:**\\n\\n*   Failed trajectories can be paired with ideal reflections to guide future changes in the plan, using a few-shot example approach.\\n*   Reflections are added to the agent\\'s working memory to be used as context when querying the LLM for subsequent actions.\\n---\\nQuestion: *  What tools and APIs can LLM-based agents use to interact with their environment?\\nAnswer: LLM-based agents can interact with their environment using a variety of tools and APIs. Here are some examples:\\n\\n*   **External Tool APIs:** LLMs can be fine-tuned to use external tool APIs, and the use of these APIs can improve the quality of the model\\'s outputs. Examples include ChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API function calling. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\n\\n*   **Hugging Face Models:** Frameworks like HuggingGPT allow LLMs to use models available on platforms like Hugging Face, selecting models based on descriptions and summarizing responses based on the execution results.\\n\\n*   **API-Bank:**  API-Bank contains a diverse set of commonly used APIs, including search engines, calculators, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, and account authentication workflows.  LLMs can use an API search engine to find the right API and then use its documentation to make a call.\\n\\nIn summary, LLM-based agents can leverage external tools and APIs to perform a wide range of tasks by interacting with their environment. The selection and usage of these tools is typically orchestrated by the LLM itself, acting as the agent\\'s \"brain.\"'"

              "'```\\nTask decomposition, in the context of Large Language Model (LLM) agents, refers to the process of breaking down a complex, high-level task into a series of smaller, more manageable subtasks. This strategy is crucial for enabling LLMs to tackle problems that exceed their inherent limitations in terms of context window size, computational capacity, and reasoning ability. Instead of directly attempting to solve the overarching problem, an LLM agent first identifies the key components or steps required to achieve the desired outcome. These subtasks can then be addressed sequentially, often leveraging specialized tools or resources as needed. For instance, a task like \"plan a week-long trip to Italy\" might be decomposed into subtasks such as \"research flight options,\" \"identify potential cities to visit,\" \"find accommodations in each city,\" and \"create a daily itinerary.\" The agent can then utilize specific tools (e.g., a flight search API, a map application, a hotel booking platform) to address each subtask individually. Furthermore, task decomposition facilitates improved planning, execution, and error recovery. By dividing the problem into smaller, more focused units, the agent can better track its progress, identify potential roadblocks, and adjust its approach accordingly. Various techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting, tree-of-thought prompting, and the use of specialized planning modules, have been developed to enhance task decomposition capabilities in LLM agents. Ultimately, effective task decomposition empowers LLMs to handle increasingly complex and real-world problems.\\n```\\n'"

The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.'),\n",

              "'Task decomposition for LLM agents involves breaking down large, complex tasks into smaller, more manageable subgoals. This allows the agent to handle complicated tasks more efficiently. There are several ways to approach task decomposition:\\n\\n1.  **LLM with Simple Prompting**: Using simple prompts like \"Steps for XYZ\" or \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\" to guide the LLM in breaking down the task.\\n2.  **Task-Specific Instructions**: Providing instructions tailored to the specific task, such as \"Write a story outline\" for writing a novel.\\n3.  **Human Inputs**: Incorporating human input to assist in decomposing the task.\\n\\nTechniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts extend this concept by encouraging the model to \"think step by step\" or explore multiple reasoning possibilities at each step, creating a structured approach to problem-solving.\\n'"
